# IKOR - Stoat chat bot
 [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/razvanbackpack/ikor-bot/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/razvanbackpack/ikor-bot/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
 
*Version: v0.1.2*

**NOTE: IKOR is heavily under development. Use it at your own risk.**

IKOR is a modular Stoat bot built with extensibility first: the core is intentionally simple,
so new commands and features can be added with minimal friction.
