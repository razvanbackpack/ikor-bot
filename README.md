# IKOR - Stoat chat bot
 [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/razvanbackpack/ikor-bot/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/razvanbackpack/ikor-bot/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
 
*Version: v0.1.2*

**NOTE: IKOR is heavily under development. Use it at your own risk.**

IKOR is a simple Stoat bot that aims to replicate some fun functionalities other bots had on Discord.  
This is primarily aimed at my group of friends, and built around our needs - but maybe the code helps other people that want to build bots.
